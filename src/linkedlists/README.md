## Reverse Linked List

Algorithm to reverse a singly linked list.

- [ReverseLinkedList.java](ReverseLinkedList.java)

## Detect Cycle in Linked List

Algorithm to detect a cycle in a linked list using Floydâ€™s Cycle-Finding Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare).

- [DetectCycle.java](DetectCycle.java)

## Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists

Algorithm to merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list.

- [MergeSortedLists.java](MergeSortedLists.java)

## Remove Duplicates from Linked List

Algorithm to remove duplicate elements from a sorted linked list.

- [RemoveDuplicates.java](RemoveDuplicates.java)

## Find Middle of Linked List

Algorithm to find the middle element of a linked list.

- [FindMiddle.java](FindMiddle.java)

## Delete Node from Linked List

Algorithm to delete a node from a linked list given only a pointer to the node to be deleted.

- [DeleteNode.java](DeleteNode.java)

## Palindrome Linked List

Algorithm to check if a linked list is a palindrome.

- [PalindromeLinkedList.java](PalindromeLinkedList.java)

## Linked List Intersection

Algorithm to find the intersection point of two linked lists.

- [LinkedListIntersection.java](LinkedListIntersection.java)

## Josephus Problem

Algorithm to solve the Josephus problem using a circular linked list.

- [JosephusProblem.java](JosephusProblem.java)

## Clone a Linked List with Random Pointers

Algorithm to clone a linked list where each node has a next pointer and an additional random pointer that can point to any node in the list.

- [CloneLinkedList.java](CloneLinkedList.java)

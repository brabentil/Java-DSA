## Activity Selection Problem

Greedy approach to select the maximum number of activities that don't overlap.

- [ActivitySelection.java](ActivitySelection.java)

## Huffman Coding

Algorithm to build a Huffman tree and generate Huffman codes for a set of characters based on their frequencies.

- [HuffmanCoding.java](HuffmanCoding.java)

## Kruskal's Algorithm

Greedy algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph.

- [Kruskal.java](Kruskal.java)

## Prim's Algorithm

Greedy algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph by growing the tree one edge at a time.

- [Prims.java](Prims.java)

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

Algorithm to find the shortest path from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a graph with non-negative weights.

- [Dijkstra.java](Dijkstra.java)

## Fractional Knapsack Problem

Greedy approach to solve the fractional knapsack problem, where items can be broken into smaller pieces.

- [FractionalKnapsack.java](FractionalKnapsack.java)

## Job Sequencing Problem

Greedy algorithm to schedule jobs to maximize profit given deadlines and profits.

- [JobSequencing.java](JobSequencing.java)

## Coin Change Problem

Greedy approach to find the minimum number of coins required to make a given amount (note: this may not always be optimal in all cases).

- [CoinChange.java](CoinChange.java)

## Maximum Heap

Implementation of a max-heap data structure using a greedy approach for priority queue operations.

- [MaxHeap.java](MaxHeap.java)

## Minimum Spanning Tree

General overview of algorithms to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph, including Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms.

- [MinimumSpanningTree.java](MinimumSpanningTree.java)

## Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Approximation

Greedy heuristic approach to find an approximate solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem. The Nearest Neighbor algorithm is an example that builds a tour by repeatedly visiting the nearest unvisited city.

- [TSPApproximation.java](TSPApproximation.java)
